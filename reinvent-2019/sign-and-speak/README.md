# Sign & Speak - AI-powered Communication

<p align="center"><img src="img/sign-and-speak-logo-small.png" /></p>

## 1. Project Overview

TODO

## 2. Project Abstract

Sign & Speak facilitates communication between users of spoken language and users of sign language. By applying AI models trained to transcribe speech and interpret sign language, combined with a camera and a microphone, the tool enables two-way conversation in situations where communication was previously challenging.

**Q: There is more than one sign language?**

**A:** Yes! By some estimates there are perhaps [300 sign languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sign_languages). Although ASL (American Sign Language) is probably the most well-known of these languages, the Sign & Speak project was built to support [Auslan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auslan) (Australian Sign Language).

**Q: Will this method work for sign languages other than Auslan?**

**A:** We believe our method can be applied to any sign language. All you need is the training data to train a new model for the sign language of your choice. We describe our approach for collecting training data in the User Guide section of this document.

**Q: Can you share your Auslan data set and/or model?**

**A:** To protect the privacy of the volunteers who helped us build our Auslan model, we will not release the data or the model. However, with the code made available in this repository, you can train a new model on your own data.

**Q: What are the limitations of this method?**

**A:** TODO

**Q: What are the future plans for this project?**

**Q: What is the animal in your logo?**

**A:** It's a [quokka](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=quokka&t=ffnt&atb=v176-1&iax=images&ia=images), a marsupial found only in Australia. We are not professional artists. ;)
