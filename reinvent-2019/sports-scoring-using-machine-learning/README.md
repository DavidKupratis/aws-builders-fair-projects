# Sports Scoring using Machine Learning #

## Overview ##

This project demonstrates the ability to determine and display the score of a sport which uses differential based scoring such as Cornhole, but the technology could be applied to darts or other sports as well. A camera captures images of the Cornhole board as players complete, and an Amazon SageMaker model predicts the score based on the position of bags in the images it receives.
